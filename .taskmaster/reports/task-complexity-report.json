		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Project Structure and Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project initialization task into subtasks covering: 1) Directory structure creation, 2) NPM initialization and package.json configuration, 3) Dependencies installation, and 4) Basic HTML file setup. Include specific commands and file contents for each subtask.",
			"reasoning": "This is a straightforward setup task with well-defined steps. The complexity is low as it involves standard npm commands and basic file structure creation. The steps are already well-documented in the task details, but can be organized into logical subtasks for better tracking."

		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Implement SMART Launch HTML Entry Point",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the SMART launch implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Creating the basic launch.html structure with proper HTML elements, 2) Implementing the SMART authorization code with the FHIR client library, and 3) Testing the launch sequence with the provided test URL.",
			"reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity as it involves understanding the SMART on FHIR launch protocol and implementing the correct OAuth2 initialization. The code is provided but needs to be properly integrated and tested. Breaking it into structure, implementation, and testing makes logical sense."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Implement OAuth2 Authorization Flow",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the OAuth2 authorization flow implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Creating the auth.js module with core authentication functions, 2) Implementing secure token storage using sessionStorage, 3) Adding comprehensive error handling for authentication failures, 4) Ensuring tokens are properly included in subsequent API requests, and 5) Testing the complete authentication flow.",
			"reasoning": "This task has higher complexity as it deals with security-critical OAuth2 implementation. It requires understanding of authentication flows, secure token storage, and proper error handling. The security implications and potential edge cases make this more complex than basic setup tasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Extract Patient Context from Launch Parameters",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the patient context extraction task into subtasks covering: 1) Creating the patient-context.js module with the getPatientContext function, 2) Implementing error handling for missing patient context, 3) Creating a function to display basic patient information in the UI, and 4) Testing with the specified test patient.",
			"reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity as it requires understanding the FHIR patient resource structure and properly extracting context from the authenticated client. Error handling for edge cases adds complexity, and the task requires integration with both the authentication system and UI components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Implement FHIR Client for AllergyIntolerance Queries",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the FHIR client implementation for allergy queries into subtasks covering: 1) Creating the fhir-client.js module with the getAllergyData function, 2) Implementing pagination handling for large result sets, 3) Adding comprehensive error handling for query failures, 4) Handling the case where no allergies are found, and 5) Testing with the specified test patient.",
			"reasoning": "This task has higher complexity as it involves working with the FHIR API to query specific resources. It requires understanding of FHIR resource relationships, query parameters, and handling pagination. Error handling and edge cases (like no allergies found) add to the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Create JSON Display Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the JSON display functionality into subtasks covering: 1) Creating the json-display.js module with the displayJsonData function, 2) Implementing CSS styling for the JSON display, and 3) Adding copy-to-clipboard functionality for user convenience.",
			"reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity as it involves DOM manipulation and formatting JSON data for display. The core functionality is straightforward, but proper styling and user convenience features like copy-to-clipboard add some complexity. The task is well-defined with clear requirements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling and Messaging",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the error handling implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Creating the error-handler.js module with displayError and handleNoAllergies functions, 2) Implementing CSS styling for error and info messages, 3) Adding specific error handling for common scenarios (authentication failures, network issues, server errors), and 4) Implementing retry logic for transient errors.",
			"reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity as it requires comprehensive error handling across multiple potential failure points. It involves both technical error detection and user-friendly error presentation. The variety of error scenarios and appropriate recovery strategies adds complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Create Main Application Entry Point",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the main application entry point implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Creating the index.html structure with all necessary elements, 2) Implementing the main app.js script with the application initialization flow, 3) Creating the CSS styling for the main application, 4) Implementing responsive design for various screen sizes, 5) Ensuring proper module imports and initialization, and 6) Testing the complete application flow.",
			"reasoning": "This task has high complexity as it integrates all other components into a cohesive application. It requires understanding how all modules interact and orchestrating the complete application flow. The task involves HTML structure, JavaScript logic, CSS styling, and responsive design considerations, making it more complex than individual component tasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 21,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Cross-Browser Compatibility and Testing",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the cross-browser compatibility and testing task into subtasks covering: 1) Creating the browser-compatibility.js module with feature detection, 2) Implementing the test.js script for validating key functionality, 3) Testing in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), 4) Documenting test results and browser compatibility, and 5) Implementing fallbacks for browser-specific issues.",
			"reasoning": "This task has higher complexity due to the challenges of ensuring consistent behavior across different browsers. It involves feature detection, comprehensive testing, and potential fallback implementations. The variety of browsers and potential compatibility issues adds significant complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 22,
			"taskTitle": "Create Documentation and Deployment Instructions",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the documentation task into subtasks covering: 1) Creating the README.md with setup instructions and usage guide, 2) Creating a CONTRIBUTING.md with development guidelines, 3) Adding inline code documentation with JSDoc comments, and 4) Creating a troubleshooting guide for common issues.",
			"reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity as it requires comprehensive documentation covering multiple aspects of the application. While not technically challenging, it requires clear communication and thorough coverage of setup, usage, development, and troubleshooting. The documentation needs to be accurate and accessible to different audiences."
