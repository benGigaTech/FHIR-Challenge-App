## Known Issues and Workarounds

### Issue 1: Session Storage Limitations in Safari Private Browsing
**Affected Browsers:** Safari
**Description:** When using Safari in Private Browsing mode, session storage has a limited capacity and may be cleared unexpectedly.
**Workaround:** The application detects this limitation and falls back to in-memory storage for the session duration.

### Issue 2: CORS Preflight Handling
**Affected Browsers:** All browsers
**Description:** Some FHIR servers may not properly support CORS preflight requests, which can cause authentication issues.
**Workaround:** The application includes retry logic with appropriate headers to handle preflight request failures.

## Browser-Specific Notes

### Chrome
- Performs optimally with all features
- Developer tools provide detailed network monitoring for FHIR requests
- Recommended for development and testing

### Firefox
- Performs well with all features
- Privacy features may require additional configuration for persistent logins
- Developer tools provide excellent JavaScript debugging

### Safari
- Minor issues with session storage in private browsing
- May require enabling "Allow Cross-Website Tracking" for some FHIR servers
- Performance is good on macOS devices

### Edge
- Full compatibility with all features
- Integrated with Windows authentication which can be beneficial for enterprise environments
- Developer tools similar to Chrome

## Minimum Browser Requirements

To use this application, users should have one of the following browsers:

- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13.1+
- Edge 80+ (Chromium-based)
- Any other modern browser with ES6 support, Fetch API, and localStorage/sessionStorage

## Testing Methodology

The application was tested using the following methodology:

1. **Automated Feature Detection**
   - Browser feature compatibility check using the built-in `checkBrowserCompatibility()` function
   - Results viewable in the browser console and in the compatibility report

2. **Functional Testing**
   - SMART launch sequence
   - Authentication flow
   - Patient context retrieval
   - Allergy data fetching and display
   - Error handling scenarios

3. **Visual Inspection**
   - UI rendering consistency
   - Responsive design behavior
   - Error message display

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Load time measurements
   - API response handling
   - UI responsiveness

## Generating Your Own Compatibility Report

To generate a browser compatibility report for your environment:

1. Launch the application using the standard SMART launch URL
2. Navigate to `/report.html` in the same domain
3. The report will automatically run compatibility tests
4. Save or print the report for documentation

## Recommendations for End Users

- Use Chrome or Edge for the best experience
- Ensure cookies and local storage are enabled
- For healthcare environments, use the latest browser versions that have passed organizational security reviews
- If experiencing issues, try clearing browser cache and cookies

## Future Compatibility Considerations

As browsers and the FHIR standard evolve, the following areas will need ongoing compatibility monitoring:

- Changes to browser security models affecting CORS and authentication
- Updates to the SMART on FHIR authorization specifications
- New FHIR resource formats and API patterns
- Browser vendor-specific privacy features that may impact storage and tracking
